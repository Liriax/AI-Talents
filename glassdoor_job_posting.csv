Consultant as Senior Scientist for Low Carbon Development Initiative (LCDI),-1,"Program Overview

The Low Carbon Development Initiative (LCDI) is a major undertaking by Indonesias Ministry of Planning (BAPPENAS) aimed to mainstream principles of sustainable development in policy making. It relies on the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA or KLHS), a methodological framework that pursues a change of paradigm away from an old unsustainable model of utilization of natural resources and of reliance on high carbon emission sources of energy; and into a new sustainable model that preserves the countrys vast natural capital base, while shifting towards renewable, low carbon sources of energy. The LCDI policies now has been incorporated in the National Medium Term Development Plan, so called RPJMN 2020-2024.

The analytical work of LCDI has offered insights not only on the actions for moving into a path of low carbon development, but also on the expected co-benefits derived from climate action. Results of the analysis show unequivocal gains in terms of value addition, employment, and welfare indicators, associated with a transition to low carbon systems and a growth model that preserves the countrys natural capital, including forests, biodiversity and water resources. Moreover, such gains can be expected to occur even in the short to medium term, in as much as actions identified under the LCDI are applied efficiently and with sufficient force and coherence, so that no trade-offs are generally expected from embracing low carbon policies.

New Climate Economy (NCE) and WRI Indonesia with funding support from the UKCCU has been supporting BAPPENAS since 2018 by providing expertise in analytics, engagement and communications on the economic-social-environmental nexus.

Consultant as Senior Scientist for Low Carbon Development Initiative (LCDI),-1,"Program Overview

The Low Carbon Development Initiative (LCDI) is a major undertaking by Indonesias Ministry of Planning (BAPPENAS) aimed to mainstream principles of sustainable development in policy making. It relies on the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA or KLHS), a methodological framework that pursues a change of paradigm away from an old unsustainable model of utilization of natural resources and of reliance on high carbon emission sources of energy; and into a new sustainable model that preserves the countrys vast natural capital base, while shifting towards renewable, low carbon sources of energy. The LCDI policies now has been incorporated in the National Medium Term Development Plan, so called RPJMN 2020-2024.

The analytical work of LCDI has offered insights not only on the actions for moving into a path of low carbon development, but also on the expected co-benefits derived from climate action. Results of the analysis show unequivocal gains in terms of value addition, employment, and welfare indicators, associated with a transition to low carbon systems and a growth model that preserves the countrys natural capital, including forests, biodiversity and water resources. Moreover, such gains can be expected to occur even in the short to medium term, in as much as actions identified under the LCDI are applied efficiently and with sufficient force and coherence, so that no trade-offs are generally expected from embracing low carbon policies.

New Climate Economy (NCE) and WRI Indonesia with funding support from the UKCCU has been supporting BAPPENAS since 2018 by providing expertise in analytics, engagement and communications on the economic-social-environmental nexus. The project collaborates with a variety of partners in Indonesia as well as internationally.
